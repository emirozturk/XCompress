# XCompress: LLM Assisted Python-based Text Compression Toolkit

XCompress is an adaptable tool designed to streamline the selection and evaluation of text compression algorithms. Leveraging a combination of manual selection, AI-driven recommendations (via CSM), brute-force optimization, and comprehensive benchmarking, XCompress empowers users to achieve optimal text compression for their specific requirements.

## Key Features

* **Manual Algorithm Selection:** Researchers and practitioners can exercise fine-grained control by manually choosing from a diverse set of established compression algorithms.
* **CSM-Guided Algorithm Recommendation:** The integrated CSM (Compression Selection Model) leverages artificial intelligence to intelligently suggest the most suitable algorithm based on user-defined priorities, such as minimizing compression time, decompression time, or achieving the highest compression ratio.
* **Brute-Force Optimization:** For scenarios demanding the absolute best compression, XCompress offers a brute-force search functionality that systematically evaluates all available algorithms to identify the one yielding the smallest compressed file size.
* **Comprehensive Benchmarking:** A robust benchmarking module facilitates direct comparison of algorithm performance on specified datasets, aiding in evidence-based decision-making.
* **Extensibility for Custom Algorithms:** XCompress allows users to seamlessly integrate and evaluate their own novel compression algorithms, fostering innovation and customization.

## Installation

## Usage

**Interactive Mode**

Initiate the interactive mode by executing the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Navigate through the menu-driven interface using arrow keys and select options using the Enter key.

**Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

For scripted or automated workflows, utilize the command-line interface:

```bash
python main.py <command> [options]
```

**Command Reference**

* `manual <algorithm_name> <input_filename> [--output_filename]`
  * `algorithm_name`: The identifier of the desired compression algorithm (e.g., "gzip", "bzip2", "lzma").
  * `input_filename`: The path to the text file to be compressed.
  * `--output_filename` (optional): The name to be assigned to the resulting compressed file.

* `csm <mode> <input_filename> [--output_filename]`
  * `mode`: Specify the optimization goal: "fast-compression", "fast-decompression", or "best-compression".
  * `input_filename`: The path to the text file.
  * `--output_filename` (optional): The name for the compressed file.

* `brute_force <input_filename> <out_folder> [--delete_except_minimum]`
  * `input_filename`: The path to the text file.
  * `out_folder`: Directory where output files are stored.
  * `--delete_except_minimum` (optional): Add this param to retain only the smallest compressed file generated during the brute-force process.

* `benchmark <benchmark_type> <input_filename> [--output_to_file] [--output_plots] <algorithm_names> [--output_filename]`
  * `benchmark_type`: Choose "compress" for compression-only benchmarks or "compress_decompress" for compression and decompression benchmarks.
  * `input_filename`: The path to the text file.
  * `--output_to_file` (optional): Add this param to save benchmark results in a structured file format.
  * `--output_plots` (optional): Add this param to generate visual plots summarizing the benchmark results.
  * `algorithm_names`: A space-separated list of algorithm names or custom configuration names to include in the benchmark.
  * `--output_filename` (optional): The path to save the benchmark results file (defaults to input filename with .<algorithm> extension).

* `config_creation <name> <executable_path> [--input_file_param] [--output_file_param] [--compression_params] [--decompression_params] <extension>`
  * `name`: The name of the new configuration.
  * `executable_path`: The path to the executable for the compression algorithm.
  * `--input_file_param` (optional): The parameter for the input file in the executable command.
  * `--output_file_param` (optional): The parameter for the output file in the executable command.
  * `--compression_params` (optional): List of parameters for the compression process.
  * `--decompression_params` (optional): List of parameters for the decompression process (if applicable).
  * `extension`: The file extension to use for compressed files generated by this configuration.

* `visualization <file_path>`
  * `file_path`: The path to the JSON file to visualize.
